;;; Commentary:
;; This implements RFC 6455, which can be found at
;; http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455.
;;
;; This library contains code to connect Emacs as a client to a
;; websocket server, and for Emacs to act as a server for websocket
;; connections.
;;
;; Websockets clients are created by calling `websocket-open', which
;; returns a `websocket' struct.  Users of this library use the
;; websocket struct, and can call methods `websocket-send-text', which
;; sends text over the websocket, or `websocket-send', which sends a
;; `websocket-frame' struct, enabling finer control of what is sent.
;; A callback is passed to `websocket-open' that will retrieve
;; websocket frames called from the websocket.  Websockets are
;; eventually closed with `websocket-close'.
;;
;; Server functionality is similar.  A server is started with
;; `websocket-server' called with a port and the callbacks to use,
;; which returns a process.  The process can later be closed with
;; `websocket-server-close'.  A `websocket' struct is also created
;; for every connection, and is exposed through the callbacks.

(cl-defstruct (websocket

            (:constructor websocket-inner-create))
  "A websocket structure.
This follows the W3C Websocket API, except translated to elisp
idioms.  The API is implemented in both the websocket struct and
additional methods.  Due to how defstruct slots are accessed, all
API methods are prefixed with \"websocket-\" and take a websocket
as an argument, so the distrinction between the struct API and
the additional helper APIs are not visible to the caller.

A websocket struct is created with `websocket-open'.

`ready-state' contains one of `connecting', `open', or
`closed', depending on the state of the websocket.

The W3C API \"bufferedAmount\" call is not currently implemented,
since there is no elisp API to get the buffered amount from the
subprocess.  There may, in fact, be output data buffered,
however, when the `on-message' or `on-close' callbacks are
called.

`on-open', `on-message', `on-close', and `on-error' are described
in `websocket-open'.

The `negotiated-extensions' slot lists the extensions accepted by
both the client and server, and `negotiated-protocols' does the
same for the protocols."

  "Open a websocket connection to URL, returning the `websocket' struct.
The PROTOCOL argument is optional, and setting it will declare to
the server that this client supports the protocols in the list
given.  We will require that the server also has to support that
protocols.

Similar logic applies to EXTENSIONS, which is a list of conses,
the car of which is a string naming the extension, and the cdr of
which is the list of parameter strings to use for that extension.
The parameter strings are of the form \"key=value\" or \"value\".
EXTENSIONS can be NIL if none are in use.  An example value would
be (\"deflate-stream\" . (\"mux\" \"max-channels=4\")).

Cookies that are set via `url-cookie-store' will be used during
communication with the server, and cookies received from the
server will be stored in the same cookie storage that the
`url-cookie' package uses.

Optionally you can specify
ON-OPEN, ON-MESSAGE and ON-CLOSE callbacks as well.

The ON-OPEN callback is called after the connection is
established with the websocket as the only argument.  The return
value is unused.

The ON-MESSAGE callback is called after receiving a frame, and is
called with the websocket as the first argument and
`websocket-frame' struct as the second.  The return value is
unused.

The ON-CLOSE callback is called after the connection is closed, or
failed to open.  It is called with the websocket as the only
argument, and the return value is unused.

The ON-ERROR callback is called when any of the other callbacks
have an error.  It takes the websocket as the first argument, and
a symbol as the second argument either `on-open', `on-message',
or `on-close', and the error as the third argument. Do NOT
rethrow the error, or else you may miss some websocket messages.
You similarly must not generate any other errors in this method.
If you want to debug errors, set
`websocket-callback-debug-on-error' to t, but this also can be
dangerous is the debugger is quit out of.  If not specified,
`websocket-default-error-handler' is used.

For each of these event handlers, the client code can store
arbitrary data in the `client-data' slot in the returned
websocket.

The following errors might be thrown in this method or in
websocket processing, all of them having the error-condition
`websocket-error' in addition to their own symbol:

`websocket-unsupported-protocol': Data in the error signal is the
protocol that is unsupported.  For example, giving a URL starting
with http by mistake raises this error.

`websocket-wss-needs-emacs-24': Trying to connect wss protocol
using Emacs < 24 raises this error.  You can catch this error
also by `websocket-unsupported-protocol'.

`websocket-received-error-http-response': Data in the error
signal is the integer error number.

`websocket-invalid-header': Data in the error is a string
describing the invalid header received from the server.

`websocket-unparseable-frame': Data in the error is a string
describing the problem with the frame.

`nowait': If NOWAIT is true, return without waiting for the
connection to complete.

`custom-headers-alist': An alist of custom headers to pass to the
server. The car is the header name, the cdr is the header value.
These are different from the extensions because it is not related
to the websocket protocol.
